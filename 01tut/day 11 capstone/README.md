Blackjack is a game that played using cards and the goal of the game is to add up your cards to the largest number without going over 21.

 If the cards in your hand add up two more than 21, then it's called a bust and it means that you lose immediately.And it doesn't matter how much you've gone over 21, as long as it's over 21, then you lose.
 
 Now the way that the cause are counted is that all the cards from 2 to 10 count as their face value. So a six is a six and a nine is a nine, et cetera. But the Jack, Queen and King each count as 10 and the other special card is the Ace.

 Now the Ace can either count as a one towards your total, or it can count as an 11. And depending on whether, if you've gone over 21 or whether if you're under 21, you can decide which value you want your Ace to represent.
