Welcome back to Kalide Academy.
This is our HTML and CSS course.
Today we'll be talking about the initial steps into starting up our programming env in which you'll be coding in.
and when we talk about programming/coding environment we mean our the text editor/application used in adherence to the features of our computer system and our special preferences.

So, defining a text editor:
A text editor is system or program that allows a user to edit text.
Well, that is the simple definition because it does more than just edit text,
Text editors have been advanced to debug programs, run and compile scripts, test run and simulate results for even Artificial intelligence programs and many more....

There are a lot of editors in the world already, so what we're looking for is something to meet our taste.

A list of them are:
1. Notepad
2. Sublime Text
3. Atom
4. Visual Studio Code
5. Notepad++
6. Vim
7. Komondo Edit
8. Brackets

Thou, some might seem to be more advanced than others, it still all depends on the user and his specific needs.

For our course we'll be making use of Visual Studio Code on a Windows, we will be installing VS code on both windows and linux, but for the rest of the course will be using Visual Studio code on Windows.
There is a link to the Visual Studio code download page currently on the screen and in case you could not get it, it is also available below our video, that is our description page: "https://code.visualstudio.com/Download".

If your not aware of your system architecture on a Windows system
Just follow these steps:
Left-click on your windows start or the Windows key on your keyboard and type "this pc"
